# Snake-Game
🎮 This is not just a snake game. It’s the snake game – now with names, rankings, and 🏆 bragging rights.

You’re a hungry green snake 🟢 dropped into a square world of grass tiles ⬛ and apples 🍎. Your mission? Eat apples. Get longer. Don’t eat yourself. And absolutely don’t smash into a wall. (That’s embarrassing.)

🍽️ Every apple you munch gives you one point and makes your body longer — which also makes self-collision way more likely. So yeah, your worst enemy... is you. 😅

Before the game begins, you can:

Enter your username (so your glorious score is immortalized),

Or go incognito as a mysterious guest (but sorry, no leaderboard for ghosts 👻),

Or just view the leaderboard to admire your rivals,

Or... exit, if you’re not feeling brave today.

🕹️ During the game:

Use w a s d to move up, left, down, right respectively.

Type e anytime to gracefully rage-quit (and still see your final score & rank).

💀 Hit a wall? Game over.
🔁 Run into yourself? Game over.
🍏 Grab an apple? Nice! Keep going!
🏁 Exit like a legend? Sure, we’ll still tell you your score.

The higher your score, the higher your spot on the leaderboard. Beat your friends. Beat your past self. Just don’t beat the wall. Happy slithering! 🐍
